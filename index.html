    <h3><u>Career as a scientist</u></h3>
    <p>
      After graduating from the <b>Madras Institute of Technology</b> in 1960, Kalam
      became a member of the  <b>Defence Research & Development Service</b> and joined
      the <b>Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research</b> and
      <b>Development Organisation (DRDO)</b> as a scientist. During his early career,
      he was involved in the design of small hovercraft, and remained
      unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Later, he joined the
      Indian National Committee for Space Research, working under renowned space
      scientist Vikram Sarabhai.He was interviewed and recruited into </b>Indian
      Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</b> by H. G. S. Murthy, the first director
      of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumba_Equatorial_Rocket_Launching_Station">Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.    In 1969, Kalam transferred to ISRO where he became the project director of India's first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle">satellite launch vehicle (SLV) </a>which successfully deployed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohini_(satellite)">Rohini </a>satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980
</a>
    </p>

    <P>In May 1974, Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiling_Buddha">Smiling Buddha </a>as the representative of Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, even though he was officially not part of the project. In the 1970s, Kalam directed two projects, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Devil">Project Devil </a>and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles using the technology from the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the union cabinet, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted funds for these aerospace projects under Kalam's directorship through her discretionary powers.</P>

 <h3><u>Presidency</u></h3>
  <p>On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance which was in power at the time, expressed its intention to nominate Kalam for the post of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_India">president of India</a>.His candidature was backed by the opposition parties including the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party. After the support for Kalam, incumbent president K. R. Narayanan chose not to seek a re-election. Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:</p>
  <pre>  "I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture "</pre>
 <p>On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by then prime minister <i>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</i> and senior cabinet members. He faced off against <B>Lakshmi Sahgal</B>, and the polling for the presidential election was held on 15 July 2002, in the Indian parliament and the state assemblies, with the media predicting a win for Kalam. The counting was held on 18 July, and Kalam won the elections after securing 922,884 electoral votes as against the 107,366 votes won by Sahgal. He was sworn in as the 11th president of India on 25 July 2002. He was the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy the top chair at Rashtrapati Bhawan.</p>

He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition, and upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.
